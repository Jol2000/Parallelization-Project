# Parallelization-Project
## **Introduction** 

The software application I’ve chosen to parallelise is bioinformatics, k-mer signatures, this application is written in C++, and is associated with computational genomics and sequence analysis. Furthermore, the application reads .fasta files containing sequences, then computing a k-mer signature for each sequence, and saving these signatures into a binary file format. In bioinformatics, k-mers are substrings of length k contained within a genomic sequence, which represents certain signatures to describe different genomes or regions in a sequence. Moreover, the frequency set of k-mers in a class of genomic sequences can be classified as a “signature” of the underlying sequence, and when comparing these frequencies, it’s computationally easier than sequence alignment, a way of arranging genomic sequences to identify similarities between these sequences, and this is also an important method in alignment-free sequence analysis that approaches molecular sequence and structure data providing an alternative over alignment-based approaches.
